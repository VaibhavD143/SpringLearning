OneToMany relation:
    Bidirectional:
    - @JoinColumn is 'many' side,which owns a foreign key
    - mappedBy on 'one' side
    - Generate emplyees and add them
    - generate accounts and and connect them with employee, add accounts individually
    - and put optional false so no account can exist without employee associated with it.

Load() vs Get():
    -load will generate proxy object while get will actually feth object from DB.
    -load throws exception if entry not exist and get returns null
- whenever we want to set employee in account, we use load to get employee as we just need to use reference of it to set
